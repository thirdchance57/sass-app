#Sassy-Art (Styling Rails Apps with SASS)

This is a sample Rails app (limited functionality -- Index action only) designed for the SASS lesson. 

You should be able to do a ```git pull``` and then a ```bundle install``` and ```rake db:seed``` to get this up and running. (If you have trouble with Mongoid, remove the Gemfile.lock and take the github reference out of the Gemfile, then re-bundle!)
